# Friends Page Backend Integration

## Overview
Successfully removed mock data and integrated the Friends page with the backend API. The page now displays real connections data and allows users to discover new people to connect with.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Configuration Updates
- **File**: `frontend/src/config/api.js`
- **Changes**: Added connections endpoints for backend communication
```javascript
CONNECTIONS: {
  MY_CONNECTIONS: `${API_BASE_URL}/connections/my-connections`,
  STATS: `${API_BASE_URL}/connections/stats`,
  SEND_REQUEST: `${API_BASE_URL}/connections/send-request`,
  RESPOND: (id) => `${API_BASE_URL}/connections/respond/${id}`,
  REMOVE: (id) => `${API_BASE_URL}/connections/${id}`,
}
```

### 2. Custom Hooks Created
- **File**: `frontend/src/hooks/useConnections.js`
  - Manages user's existing connections
  - Handles connection statistics
  - Provides functions to send/remove connections
  - Transforms backend data to frontend format

- **File**: `frontend/src/hooks/useDiscoverPeople.js`
  - Fetches profiles from workers search API
  - Transforms profile data for display
  - Handles search filtering and pagination

### 3. Component Updates

#### Friends Page (`frontend/src/pages/Friend/Friends.jsx`)
- **Removed**: All mock data arrays
- **Added**: 
  - Integration with custom hooks
  - Two-mode toggle (My Connections / Discover People)
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Real-time data fetching with refresh functionality
  - Enhanced search and filtering
  - Connection statistics display

#### Friend Card (`frontend/src/components/FriendCard.jsx`)
- **Added**: 
  - Connect button for discover mode
  - Dynamic button states (Connect/Connected)
  - Enhanced functionality for email/phone actions
  - Support for different card layouts

## API Integration

### Backend Endpoints Used
1. **GET** `/api/connections/my-connections` - Fetch user's connections
2. **GET** `/api/connections/stats` - Get connection statistics
3. **POST** `/api/connections/send-request` - Send connection request
4. **DELETE** `/api/connections/:id` - Remove connection
5. **GET** `/api/profiles/search/workers` - Discover new people

### Data Transformation
The backend data is transformed to match the frontend expectations:

```javascript
// Backend format -> Frontend format
{
  _id: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  userType: "worker",
  profilePicture: "url"
} 
// Becomes:
{
  id: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  name: "John Doe",
  profession: "Skilled Worker",
  avatar: "url",
  role: "Worker",
  category: "general"
}
```
